The **Climate, Land, Energy and Water Systems (CLEWs)** framework embodies a comprehensive approach to resource management, acknowledging the intricate interconnections between land use, climate change, and energy decisions. Since its rise to prominence in the early 2010s, CLEWs has provided a holistic methodology for analyzing complex resource interactions, particularly within the framework of the **Sustainable Development Goals**.

International organizations such as **UNDESA** and **IAEA** are championing the CLEWs framework through capacity-building initiatives in the Global South, and it is increasingly being woven into higher education curricula. While CLEWs can be implemented using various modeling tools like **OSeMOSYS** and **LEAP**, challenges persist regarding tool accessibility and the development of technical capacityâ€”both of which have become critical areas of focus in recent years.
