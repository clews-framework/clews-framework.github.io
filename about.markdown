The Climate, Land, Energy and Water systems (CLEWs) framework represents an integrated approach to resource management that recognises the interconnected nature of land use, climate change, and energy choices. Gaining prominence since the early 2010s, CLEWs offers a holistic method for analysing complex resource interactions, particularly in the context of Sustainable Development Goals. International organizations like UNDESA and IAEA are promoting CLEWs through capacity building in the global south, and the framework is increasingly being incorporated into higher education curricula. While CLEWs can be applied using various modelling tools such as OSeMOSYS and LEAP, challenges remain in tool accessibility and building technical capacity, with both becoming key areas of development in recent years.
