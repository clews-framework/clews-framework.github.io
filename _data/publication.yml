- abstract: Despite the excitement around the nexus between land, energy and water
    resource systems, policies enacted to govern and use these resources are still
    formulated in isolation, without considering the interdependencies. Using a Ugandan
    case study, we highlight the impact that one policy change in the energy system
    will have on other resource systems. We focus on deforestation, long term electricity
    supply planning, crop production, water consumption, land-use change and climate
    impacting greenhouse gas (GHG) trajectories. In this study, an open-source integrated
    modelling framework is used to map the ripple effects of a policy change related
    to reducing biomass consumption. We find that, despite the reduction in deforestation
    of woodlands and forests, the GHG emissions in the power sector are expected to
    increase in between 2040–2050, owing to higher fossil fuel usage. This policy
    change is also likely to increase the cost of electricity generation, which in
    turn affects the agricultural land types. There is an unforeseen shift from irrigated
    to rainfed type land due to higher electricity costs. With this integrated model
    setup for Uganda, we highlight the need for integrated policy planning that takes
    into consideration the interlinkages between the resource systems and cross propagation
    effects.

- abstract: (Background) There have been numerous studies that consider the nexus
    interactions between energy systems, land use, water use and climate adaptation
    and impacts. These studies have filled a gap in the literature to allow for more
    effective policymaking by considering the trade-offs between land use, energy
    infrastructure as well as the use of water for agriculture and providing energy
    services. Though these studies fill a significant gap in the modelling literature,
    we argue that more work is needed to effectively consider policy trade-offs between
    the 17 United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) to avoid missing important

- abstract: Population growth, urbanization and economic development drive the use
    of resources. Securing access to essential services such as energy, water, and
    food, while achieving sustainable development, require that policy and planning
    processes follow an integrated approach. The ‘Climate-, Land-, Energy- and Water-systems’
    (CLEWs) framework assists the exploration of interactions between (and within)
    CLEW systems via quantitative means. The approach was first introduced by the
    International Atomic Energy Agency to conduct an integrated systems analysis of
    a biofuel chain. The framework assists the exploration of interactions between
    (and within) CLEW systems via quantitative means. Its multi-institutional application
    to the case of Mauritius in 2012 initiated the deployment of the framework. A
    vast number of completed and ongoing applications of CLEWs span different spatial
    and temporal scales, discussing two or more resource interactions under different
    political contexts. Also, the studies vary in purpose. This shapes the methods
    that support CLEWs-type analyses. In this paper, we detail the main steps of the
    CLEWs framework in perspective to its application over the years. We summarise
    and compare key applications, both published in the scientific literature, as
    working papers and reports by international organizations. We discuss differences
    in terms of geographic scope, purpose, interactions represented, analytical approach
    and stakeholder involvement. In addition, we review other assessments, which contributed
    to the advancement of the CLEWs framework. The paper delivers recommendations
    for the future development of the framework, as well as keys to success in this
    type of evaluations.

- abstract: Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are important tools to analyse cross-sectoral
    interdependencies and the use of global resources. Most current tools are highly
    detailed and require expert knowledge and proprietary software to generate scenarios
    and analyse their insights. In this paper, the complementary Global Least-cost
    User-friendly CLEWs Open-Source Exploratory (GLUCOSE) model is presented as a
    highly-aggregated global IAM, open and accessible from source to solver and using
    the OSeMOSYS tool and the CLEWs framework. The model enables the exploration of
    policy measures on the future development of the integrated resource system. Thanks
    to its relatively simple structure, it requires low computational resources allowing
    for the generation of a large number of scenarios or to quickly conduct preliminary
    investigations. GLUCOSE is targeted towards education and training purposes by
    a range of interested parties, from students to stakeholders and decision-makers,
    to explore possible future pathways towards the sustainable management of global
    resources.

- abstract: Approaches that integrate feedback between climate, land, energy and water
    (CLEW) have progressed significantly in scope and complexity. The so-called nexus
    approaches have shown their usefulness in assessing strategies to achieve the
    Sustainable Development Goals in the contexts of increasing demands, resource
    scarcity, and climate change. However, most nexus analyses omit some important
    inter-linkages that could actually be addressed. The omissions often stem from
    technical and practical considerations, but also from limited dissemination of
    new open-source frameworks incorporating recent advances. We review and present
    a set of models that can meet the needs of decision makers for analysis tools
    capable of addressing a broad range of nexus questions. Particular attention is
    given to model accessibility, usability and community support. The other objective
    of this review is to discuss research gaps, and critical needs and opportunities
    for further model development from a scientific viewpoint. We explore at different
    scales where and why some nexus interactions are most relevant. We find that both
    very small scale and global models tend to neglect some CLEW interactions, but
    for different reasons. The former rarely include climate impacts, which are often
    marginal at the local level, while the latter mostly lack some aspects because
    of the complexity of large full CLEW systems at the global level.

- abstract: 'The primary impediment to adopting the Water, Energy, and Food (WEF)
    Nexus is a lack of a comprehensive and user-friendly simulation model. According
    to our search on Google Scholar and the Scopus databank, WEF Nexus studies can
    be divided into three broad categories: (1) studies about the nexus concept, (2)
    studies related to nexus modeling and software development, and (3) case studies.
    Given that the present study’s objective is to review various solutions for WEF
    Nexus modeling and also to prepare a checklist of available models to find a better
    model for nexus simulation, we excluded papers and studies which were related
    to the nexus concept. After that, we split up other papers that talked about nexus
    and software development into (1) integrated and (2) compiled approaches. Then,
    it was attempted to identify the shortcomings in each approach. It was shown that
    the existing integrated WEF Nexus models (such as MUSIASEM, NexSym, CLEW, and
    ANEMI) had some significant drawbacks compared to compiled alternatives. Several
    of the major shortcomings of existing integrated models include the following:
    (1) They did not cover all spatial scales; (2) they included only a limited number
    of interactions across WEF subsystems; and (3) some of these models were unavailable.
    Therefore, as a general result of the current study, it was shown that compiled
    approach is generally preferable compared to available integrated models. In this
    regard, we tried to find the best water simulation models to implement in the
    nexus concept. We searched for papers about water simulation models and defined
    water subsystem requirements in the nexus concept. So, we evaluated each water
    simulation model based on its ability to cover water subsystem requirements. This
    work illustrates the capability of a suitable water simulation model to be utilized
    in the nexus concept and provides a holistic checklist to choose the preferred
    water simulation model based on the needs of each issue.'

- abstract: 'Systems models are an important tool for policy and energy planning decisions.
    These models generally fall into one of three modelling paradigms: energy economy,
    capacity expansion or power sector planning. Recent work seeks to combine these
    paradigms into an integrated framework to leverage the benefits of different model
    types. There is also interest and research in representing more system interactions
    to expand the modelling nexus. However, this increases model complexity and risks
    creating more black box models that are not well understood or trusted by users
    or policymakers. To understand the trade-offs and best practices of using combined
    models, we review current modelling practices, including an overview of the different
    modelling paradigms in the literature, how combined modelling has been applied
    to date and how the nexus has been represented in different modelling applications.
    Building on the literature review, we held a series of expert elicitation workshops
    to gain insight from energy modelling domain experts who use combined models.
    Finally, we encapsulate these findings and best practices into a modelling evaluation
    framework. We find that while there is interest and research being done in these
    areas, there are no set standards for how to build these types of models, resulting
    in a wide range of practices. Increasing model complexity to develop fully hard-linked
    coupled models that are also trustworthy and transparent generally requires more
    time and resources than is worthwhile. Instead, the focus should be on avoiding
    black box models by having a clear modelling purpose and developing best practices
    that allow for clarity and transparency. Expanding the nexus to include attributes
    such as biodiversity and cultural security presents a challenge and representing
    them as a cost is not congruent to equitable policy. These aspects could be better
    incorporated into analysis using stakeholder debate and citizens'' assemblies.'

- abstract: The Climate, Land, Energy and Water systems (CLEWs) approach guides the
    development of integrated assessments. The approach includes an analytical component
    that can be performed using simple accounting methods, soft-linking tools, incorporating
    cross-systems considerations in sectoral models, or using one modelling tool to
    represent CLEW systems. This paper describes how a CLEWs quantitative analysis
    can be performed using one single modelling tool, the Open Source Energy Modelling
    System (OSeMOSYS). Although OSeMOSYS was primarily developed for energy systems
    analysis, the tool’s functionality and flexibility allow for its application to
    CLEWs. A step-by-step explanation of how climate, land, energy, and water systems
    can be represented with OSeMOSYS, complemented with the interpretation of sets,
    parameters, and variables in the OSeMOSYS code, is provided. A hypothetical case
    serves as the basis for developing a modelling exercise that exemplifies the building
    of a CLEWs model in OSeMOSYS. System-centred scenario analysis is performed with
    the integrated model example to illustrate its application. The analysis of results
    shows how integrated insights can be derived from the quantitative exercise in
    the form of conflicts, trade-offs, opportunities, and synergies. In addition to
    the modelling exercise, using the OSeMOSYS-CLEWs example in teaching, training
    and open science is explored to support knowledge transfer and advancement in
    the field.

- abstract: The increasing prevalence of wicked problems, such as climate change,
    requires a transformation in education that equips students with the skills, competencies
    and knowledge to address these complex challenges. Wicked problems are characterised
    by their incomplete, contradictory, and ever-changing requirements, rendering
    them difficult to resolve due to intricate interdependencies. Nexus thinking offers
    a valuable approach to these problems, as it emphasises the interconnectedness
    of various systems, fostering a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges
    at hand. In this paper, we propose the use of Climate, Land, Energy, and Water
    (CLEWs) modelling as an innovative pedagogical strategy tool to cultivate nexus
    thinking among students. Building upon the pioneering CLEWs pedagogical work of
    Shivakumar et al., in their ‘Introduction to CLEWs’ Open Learn course, we demonstrate
    how this approach can be utilised in a Higher Education (HE) setting in the form
    of a Masters’ module for geography students.

- abstract: This study was motivated by the high reliance on hydropower plants (HPPs)
    developed and planned along the river Nile and the fact that drought events are
    the most imminent and drastic threats to Uganda’s power production. The study
    aimed to assess HPPs’ resilience and the effectiveness of selected adaptation
    measures. The climate, land, energy, and water system (CLEWs) framework was employed
    to assess resilience amidst competing water demands and stringent environmental
    flow requirements. Under extreme dry conditions, power generation could plummet
    by 91% over the next 40 years, which translates into an annual per capita consumption
    of 19 kWh, barely sufficient to sustain a decent socioeconomic livelihood. During
    arid conditions, climate models predicted an increase in streamflow with increasing
    radiative forcing. Restricting the ecological flow to 150 m3/s could improve generation
    by 207%. In addition, if planned power plants were to be built 5 years ahead of
    schedule, the normalized mean annual plant production could increase by 23%. In
    contrast, increasing reservoir volumes for planned power plants will have no significant
    impact on generation. The path to HPP resilience could entail a combination of
    diversifying the generation mix, installing generators with varying capacities,
    and incorporating adjustable orifices on reservoirs.

- abstract: The Buffalo River catchment in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, has limited
    water resource infrastructure development, and climate change is predicted to
    increase its water supply deficits by exacerbating water distribution inequalities.
    This study evaluates and optimises current climate change policy plans on the
    Buffalo River catchments water system to aid in assessing the sustainability of
    policies that address the aforementioned challenges. The water–energy–food (WEF)
    nexus approach, which encourages system thinking by considering interconnections
    among water, energy, and food resources when developing integrated natural resource
    management strategies, was used to perform the evaluation. The water system’s
    reliability in meeting projected domestic, agricultural, and energy water demands
    under climate change conditions was used for gauging the sustainability of the
    development plans. Findings projected the existing water policy plans to increase
    the domestic water provision by .70% under climate change; however, the ,3% increase
    in irrigation and energy generation water demand coverage yielded a significant
    contrast in reliability between densely populated areas and regions with extensive
    agricultural activities. The optimised policy plans, which improved water provision
    for all considered sectors increased by .20% under climate change, are thus recommended
    for future water resource management research and dialogue in the Buffalo River
    catchment.

    activities affected by the transformation, so that policies regarding a just transition can
    be properly developed and stakeholders incentivized to take active participation
    in the process. Under baseline assumptions, a net-zero economy would have 135
    thousand more jobs by 2050 than the BAU, equivalent to 7% of the employed population
    in 2017. Energy-related jobs would triple by mid-21st century, and regions capitalizing
    on renewables would perceive the highest gain. When considering uncertainty, the
    net jobs range between 35‒750 thousand. Since net positive outcomes in terms of
    jobs are feasible, global governance should focus efforts on policies that enhance
    these.

- abstract: System models help policymakers to produce net zero decarbonization pathways.
    In 2019, Costa Rica launched its National Decarbonization Plan (NDP) – constructed
    using a detailed Open-Source energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS-CR) model and simplified
    ones for non-energy sectors. The country then developed an integrated Climate,
    Land, Energy and Water (CLEW) model to capture synergies across sectors and guide
    future climate related processes. This resulted in the CLEW-CR model. In 2020,
    the country updated its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), deploying
    a highly participatory process supported by the CLEW-CR model to guide the discussions
    with over 150 stakeholders. This paper presents the framework adopted to develop
    the CLEW-CR model (from data collection to scenarios creation and cost-benefit
    analysis) and describes its use to align its NDCs with its NDP. Over 15 different
    scenarios were produced to inform the country's dialogue during the updating process
    of its NDCs demonstrating the flexibility of this model to support multiple policy
    questions. This paper shows that deploying the NDC by 2030 and the NDP by 2050
    would result in a net economic benefit of $55 billion – about 85 % of Costa Rica's
    GDP, highlighting the economic viability of Costa Rica's commitment to a sustainable
    future.

- abstract: 'The sustainable development goals (SDGs) represent the global ambition
    to accelerate sustainable development. Several SDGs are directly related to climate
    change and policies aiming to mitigate it. This includes, among others, the set
    of SDGs that directly influence the climate, land, energy, and water (CLEW) nexus
    (SDGs 2, 6, 7, 13, 15). This study aims at understanding the synergies and trade-offs
    between climate policy and the SDGs agenda: how does near-term action on SDGs
    influence long-term climate goals? Based on a multi-model comparison, we evaluate
    three scenarios: (i) reference; (ii) climate mitigation; and (iii) a CLEW nexus
    SDGs scenario. We find clear positive effects of combining the climate and the
    sustainable development agendas. Notably, healthier diets, with reduced meat consumption,
    have strong co-benefits for climate, with positive effects across multiple SDGs:
    improvements in food security, reductions in air pollution and water stress, and
    improvements in biodiversity conservation. Such positive outcomes are prominent
    in the Global South, where regions typically at higher risk of food and energy
    insecurity and other environmental stresses (e.g. Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and
    Latin America) benefit from a shorter term agenda focusing not only on the climate
    but also on the other sustainable development dimensions. However, trade-offs
    are also observed (e.g. increases in the prices of food and electricity), especially
    in the dynamics of land and the food systems, highlighting the importance of exploring
    policy synergies: if individually applied, some measures can negatively impact
    other sustainability goals, while taking into consideration the nexus interactions
    can reduce trade-offs and increase co-benefits. Finally, near-term action on SDGs
    can help speed up the transition towards the long-term climate goals, reducing
    the reliance on negative emissions options. In 2100, the SDG scenario in significantly
    less reliant on carbon dioxide removals both from AFOLU and the energy system.'

- abstract: Understanding the dynamics of complex systems requires developing and

    Modeling the interactions as separate models contributes to building flexible

    Interaction Model (DEVS-IM) framework is developed based on the Knowledge Interchange
    Broker (KIB) approach. This KIB-based RESTful modeling composition framework is
    shown to enable systematic modeling and simulation of interactions between disparate
    simulatable models. It supports storing IMs developed for componentized Water
    Evaluation and Planning System (WEAP) and Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP)
    tools. It generates the skeleton of DEVS-IMs stored in database for DEVS-Suite
    simulator. An exemplar model consisting of water, energy, and IMs demonstrates
    this methodology for developing nexus models of water–energy systems.

    increase in land-use requirements associated with transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable
    energy sources, with the occupied land of the power system potentially increasing
    up to six times larger than the current total build-up land (depending on the

- abstract: The lack of holistic decision-making assessments has been the main reason
    behind Lebanon’s persistent energy challenges for a long time. Increasing the
    capacity of renewable electricity generation as well as conventional power plants
    running on imported fuels has been proposed to ensure energy security in Lebanon.
    However, this approach does not necessarily consider Lebanon’s most persistent
    energy challenges and the potential impacts of selected technologies on Lebanon’s
    scarce land and water resources. Relying on a System of Systems (SoS) perspective
    and considering the Climate, Land, Energy, and Water (CLEW) nexus, this study
    is an effort to help overcome Lebanon’s energy sustainability challenges while
    reducing impacts on the country’s valuable natural, economic, and social resources.
    Two parallel but complementary frameworks are used. First, through Resource Efficiency
    Assessment (REA), the potential impacts of the electricity technologies on the
    nation’s environmental and economic resources are evaluated. Next, the Sustainability
    Performance Assessment (SPA) considers a number of criteria relative to the region’s
    economic, social, environmental, and technical energy challenges. Using the Aggregate
    Performance Index (API), the relative performance of each energy is calculated
    based on the results of REA and SPA. Results suggest that offshore wind, solar
    photovoltaics, natural gas, geothermal, nuclear, and hydropower technologies are
    the most desirable electricity generation options in Lebanon based on the assumptions
    and values used in this study.

- abstract: Climate change impacts a natural and human system on the entire globe.
    Climate-related extreme weather such as drought, floods, and heat waves alters
    the ecosystems that society depends on. Climate, land, energy, and water systems
    (CLEWS) are a critical aspect of high importance on resource availability, distribution,
    and interconnection. The nexus provides a set of guidelines to South Africa that
    aims on creating a level playing field for all sectors while achieving the aims
    of the SDGs that are cross-sectoral and multilevel approaches to climate change.
    The nexus expressed three domains that included resources, governance, and security.
    It integrated a smart climate resilient with inclusion of the governance and involvement
    of the stakeholders. Recognition of spatial and sector interdependencies should
    inform policies, investment and institutional for enhancing nexus security and
    climate change towards making transition green carbon deals. The nexus offers
    an integrated approach that analyzes the trade-offs and synergies between the
    different sectors in order to maximize the efficiency of using the resources that
    adapt institutional and optimum policy arrangements. Economic transformation and
    creation of employment through green economy is one of the COP26 green deal agendas
    in curbing the carbon emissions (green house emission, industrial processes, fuel
    combustion, and fugitive emissions) as mitigation to climate change, which is
    cost-effective and economically efficient. The future climate change policy in
    the developing countries is likely to be both promoted by climate technology transfer
    and public-private cooperation (cross-sector partnership) through the technology
    mechanism of the nexus and inclusion of the gender.

- abstract: 'Climate change continues to challenge food, energy, and water systems
    (FEWS) across the globe and will figure prominently in shaping future decisions
    on how best to manage this nexus. In turn, traditionally engineered and natural
    infrastructures jointly support and hence determine FEWS performance, their vulnerabilities,
    and their resilience in light of extreme climate events. We present here a research
    framework to advance the modeling, data integration, and assessment capabilities
    that support hypothesis-driven research on FEWS dynamics cast at the macro-regional
    scale. The framework was developed to support studies on climate-induced extremes
    on food, energy, and water systems (C-FEWS) and designed to identify and evaluate
    response options to extreme climate events in the context of managing traditionally
    engineered (TEI) and nature-based infrastructures (NBI). This paper presents our
    strategy for a first stage of research using the framework to analyze contemporary
    FEWS and their sensitivity to climate drivers shaped by historical conditions
    (1980–2019). We offer a description of the computational framework, working definitions
    of the climate extremes analyzed, and example configurations of numerical experiments
    aimed at evaluating the importance of individual and combined driving variables.
    Single and multiple factor experiments involving the historical time series enable
    two categories of outputs to be analyzed: the first involving biogeophysical entities
    (e.g., crop production, carbon sequestered, nutrient and thermal pollution loads)
    and the second reflecting a portfolio of services provided by the region’s TEI
    and NBI, evaluated in economic terms. The framework is exercised in a series of
    companion papers in this special issue that focus on the Northeast and Midwest
    regions of the United States. Use of the C-FEWS framework to simulate historical
    conditions facilitates research to better identify existing FEWS linkages and
    how they function. The framework also enables a next stage of analysis to be pursued
    using future scenario pathways that will vary land use, technology deployments,
    regulatory objectives, and climate trends and extremes. It also supports a stakeholder
    engagement effort to co-design scenarios of interest beyond the research domain.'

- abstract: Historically, managers of land, energy, and water systems have not recognized
    the importance of the collective interconnections of these systems. It is simpler
    to think about these intersections as two-dimensional rather than multi-dimensional
    puzzles. However, in the context of climate change, the multiple intersections
    between systems need to be examined. Failure to consider those connections can
    result in under-appreciated risks, missed opportunities, and costly mistakes.
    Additionally, issues have different implications over time and spatial scales,
    and when considered in local contexts, are more nuanced and complex. Recent events
    also emphasize the critical need to consider social and environmental justice
    and to engage a range of interests in decision-making processes. As policy makers,
    resource managers, and researchers, we must ask ourselves the tough questions
    that will lead to innovation and creative solutions. Questions about the potential
    unintended consequences and the political, social, economic, natural and/or ecological,
    hydrological, and technical feasibility of actually implementing solutions have
    largely gone unanswered. We call on our colleagues to work together on these challenges;
    to develop and use integrated tools like scenario planning and anticipatory decision

- abstract: 'Climate change strains the global water supplies’ capability to meet
    demands, especially in regions like South Africa, where resources are already
    scarce. The interconnectedness of water, energy, and food (WEF) exacerbates this
    challenge, amplifying the impact of climate change on water resource management
    across these sectors. Thus, in strengthening the long-term resilience and reliability
    of water resources, a necessity in South Africa, research on climate change and
    the WEF nexus is needed for water resource planning and development. Employing
    the WEF nexus approach, we applied the Climate Land-Use Energy and Water Strategies
    (CLEWS) modelling framework to assess climate change impacts on the water supply-demand
    relationship, considering the domestic, agriculture (irrigation) and energy generation
    sectors, and adopting the Buffalo River catchment, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa,
    as a case study. A threefold approach was utilized: (1) water supplies and demands
    and the total unmet demands were quantified; (2) the percentages of water demands
    covered per sector were derived; and (3) the reliability of the water system to
    meet each sector’s water demands was computed. The findings projected slight decreases
    (2%) in the Buffalo River catchment’s total water demands towards the end of the
    21st century, mainly due to changes in land suitability for agriculture. While
    the water system is projected to be reliable for highly populated municipalities
    (demand coverage index > 70%; reliability index ≥ 20%), it is unreliable for sparsely
    populated and agriculturally intensive municipalities (demand coverage index ≤
    12%; reliability index = 0%). Such unreliability will strain agricultural production
    as more than 70% of irrigation water demands come from these municipalities. Nexus-smart
    water allocation and capacity development plans are recommended to manage these
    challenges and ensure a just and sustainable water supply-demand relationship
    in light of climate change.'

- abstract: A spatially distributed water-energy-food (WEF) nexus model has been developed
    using the Pardee-RAND WEF approach to analyse the WEF security of an area. The
    Pardee-RAND equations have been modified to include the earlier neglected WEF
    indicators to tackle the WEF challenges holistically. The model is coded in Python
    and has an operating system-independent graphical user interface (GUI). The model
    helps understand the WEF nexus by calculating water energy, food subindices and
    the WEF nexus index. We tested the model in the Kangsabati River Basin (distributed
    at the block level) and across India (states/union territory level). The result
    shows that the WEF nexus indices vary significantly over the country's small (block)
    to large (state) administrative units. The water energy and food subindices and
    WEF nexus index for the Kangsabati River Basin are 0.89, 0.73, 0.79 and 0.80,
    respectively, while for India, the corresponding values are 0.67, 0.53, 0.73 and
    0.63, respectively. The blocks or states/union territories needing specific policy
    interventions are identified. The study will help influence policy and resource
    planning at different administrative levels to ensure better management of WEF
    resources holistically and equitably.

- abstract: Decarbonization is a process that transforms economies to lower greenhouse
    gas (GHG) emissions per unit of economic output, aiming towards net-zero GHG emissions.
    This process could also reduce short-lived climate pollutant (SLCP) emissions,
    including black carbon and methane. They have relatively short atmospheric lifetimes
    but have large radiative forcing and impact human health. Therefore, reducing
    SLCPs can improve air pollution and help mitigate climate change. Costa Rica was
    one of the first countries to have a decarbonization plan, and many others have
    stated their goal to reach net-zero emissions by around mid-century. However,
    reducing SLCP emissions as an economy decarbonizes is not guaranteed, and few
    examples in the literature have assessed how decarbonization impacts SLCPs. This
    paper estimates the SLCP emission reductions from Costa Rica's decarbonization
    plan. Through a value chain analysis and the identification of implementation
    barriers, the paper also evaluates which policy instruments can advance SLCP mitigation
    in multiple sectors, creating implementation synergy. We find that mitigation
    measures, by 2050, in the transport, agricultural, solid waste, and industrial
    sectors avoid 25.2 kt of black carbon emissions (23 times the 2018 emissions)
    and 2167 kt of methane (15 times the 2018 emissions). However, the country faces financial
    and governance challenges in each sector that will need overcoming to implement
    the intended mitigation measures. We identify a comprehensive environmental tax
    reform, the overhauling of urban regulatory plans, the strengthening of institutional
    capabilities, and low-carbon investment with favorable financing as crucial cross-sectoral
    policy synergies that will advance the implementation of SLCP mitigation.

- abstract: 'Currently available water-energy-food (WEF) modelling frameworks to analyse
    cross-sectoral interactions often share one or more of the following gaps: (a)
    lack of integration between sectors, (b) coarse spatial representation, and (c)
    lack of reproducible methods of nexus assessment. In this paper, we present a
    novel clustering tool as an expansion to the Climate-Land-Energy-Water-Systems
    modelling framework used to quantify inter-sectoral linkages between water, energy,
    and food systems. The clustering tool uses Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering
    to aggregate spatial data related to the land and water sectors. Using clusters
    of aggregated data reconciles the need for a spatially resolved representation
    of the land-use and water sectors with the computational and data requirements
    to efficiently solve such a model. The aggregated clusters, combined together
    with energy system components, form an integrated resource planning structure.
    The modelling framework is underpinned by an open-source energy system modelling
    tool—OSeMOSYS—and uses publicly available data with global coverage. By doing
    so, the modelling framework allows for reproducible WEF nexus assessments. The
    approach is used to explore the inter-sectoral linkages between the energy, land-use,
    and water sectors of Viet Nam out to 2030. A validation of the clustering approach
    confirms that underlying trends actual crop yield data are preserved in the resultant
    clusters. Finally, changes in cultivated area of selected crops are observed and
    differences in levels of crop migration are identified.'

- abstract: Islands all over the world face common challenges connected to energy
    costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, islands have been identified as perfect
    sites for implementing and testing innovative solutions to boost the green energy
    transition towards a sustainable and clean energy system. The supply of clean
    water is a major issue that affects small islands, and desalination, particularly
    Reverse Osmosis, represents a valid solution to this challenge. In this research,
    an energy system model is used to analyse long-term water and energy supply strategies
    of the tourist island of Favignana, Italy. The model is built with the Open Source
    long-term energy modelling tool OSeMOSYS at an hourly resolution. It considers
    both the potential synergies offered by Reverse Osmosis Desalination and the use
    of water storage to store the excess electricity when needed. The indirect emissions
    for the maritime transportation of goods and fuels (i.e., water and diesel) to
    the island are also accounted for. Different energy policies are compared to understand
    how a carbon tax, a limit on emissions and no policy would impact the long-term
    energy strategy of the island. The results show that a carbon tax that covers
    also the maritime transportation sector would lead to the lowest overall cumulative
    emissions. They additionally reveal that the contribution of emissions for maritime
    transportation of goods and fuels is relevant and cannot be neglected if a full
    decarbonisation has to be achieved. On the technological side, investment in a desalination
    plant is the most viable option in all cases. Finally, for the first time, OSeMOSYS
    is applied with hourly resolution and the results are compared with those obtained
    with lower time resolution showing that inaccuracies are found both for overall
    values and for the dispatching strategies.

- abstract: The Buffalo River (BR) catchment, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Due to
    the vast majority of the BR catchment’s water demands not being fully satisfied
    in recent years, studies investigating potential climate change impacts on the
    catchment's water supply availability are needed. The study’s objective was to
    therefore assess climate change-induced surface water availability (SWA) variations
    in the BR catchment from 2020 to 2100. To achieve this, the hydrologic Water Evaluation
    and Planning model was forced with the catchment's physical and hydrological data,
    and projected climate data from an ensemble of GCMs under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios
    from CMIP5. The study findings projected increased precipitation, especially in
    the far future (2070–2100) whereby mean annual precipitation increased by 5 %
    to 8286 Mm3/annum under the worst-case climate change scenario (RCP8.5). With
    evapotranspiration and water abstractions averaging 4500 Mm3/annum and 115 Mm3/annum,
    respectively, surface runoff and SWA increased by 8 % and 10 %, yielding averages
    of 3265 Mm3/annum and 287 Mm3/annum, respectively. Even with the increased SWA,
    unmet demands also increased by 113 % towards the end of the 21st century. As
    the study established that climate change might exacerbate the BR catchment's
    water supply system's insufficiency to meet growing demands, such findings present
    an opportunity for the integrated Water-Energy-Food nexus approach to be further
    utilised for formulating sustainable water management strategies.

- abstract: Nowadays, energy policymakers are asked to develop strategies to ensure
    an affordable clean energy supply as well as minimizing investment risks. In addition,
    the rise of several community engagement schemes and the uptake of user-scale
    technologies introduce uncertainties that may result in a disruptive factor for
    energy systems evolution. This paper introduces a novel scenario analysis approach
    for local energy planning that supports policymakers and investors in prioritizing
    new renewable power plant investments, addressing the risks deriving from citizens’
    choices. Specifically, a combined analysis is performed on the adoption trends
    of distributed photovoltaic systems and electric vehicles that are expected to
    heavily influence the evolution of energy systems. For this reason, an energy
    model is developed for Pantelleria island, and its transition from an oil-based
    energy supply to a renewable one up to 2050 is investigated. It is demonstrated
    how optimal-cost renewable-based scenarios can assure a 45% to 52% CO2 emissions
    reduction and a 6% to 15% overall cost reduction with respect to the diesel-based
    business-as-usual scenario. The analyzed scenarios disclose the recommended investments
    in each renewable technology, considering their learning curves and the unpredictability
    of user-scale technology adoption. Consequently, priorities in the installation
    of renewable power plants are stressed, starting with the most resilient to future
    uncertainties, as well as promoting specific incentive measures for citizens’
    commitment at a local scale.

- abstract: The Water-Energy-Food (WEF) framework is widely used to address sustainability and
    resource management questions. However, many WEF methods miss engaging with stakeholders
    in the process. In this study, we introduce a stakeholder-driven and model-supported
    robust nexus decision-making framework. This methodology is exemplified by a case
    study in the Souss-Massa basin (SMB) which has significant importance for the
    agricultural sector in Morocco. However, the water scarcity exacerbated by climate
    change, overexploitation of groundwater and heavy use of fossil fuelsfor pumping
    is threatening the future of this fertile land. An integrated agriculture, water
    and energy model was developed to explore various potential solutions or scenarios
    such as desalination, wastewater reuse and improved water productivity. The analysis
    revealed that engaging with stakeholders and developing common robust nexus decision
    metrics is essential to establishing a shared and transparent approach to address
    the complicated nexus challenges. It also showed that no one solution can address
    all nexus challenges and highlighted the need for an integrated strategy that
    stimulates the contributions from different sectors. Finally, the transition from
    fossil fuel groundwater pumping to solar pumping is shown to be economically and
    environmentally viable.

- abstract: 'The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) mega-large urban agglomeration of China
    (CMUA) has significantly contributed to Chinese socioeconomic development. However,
    it faces severe shortages in the supply to meet the increasing demand of water,
    energy, and food resources (WEF). In order to safeguard the resource security
    of CMUA-BTH and the synergistic development of cities, and to compensate for the
    lack of dynamic analysis between urban agglomerations and WEF in previous studies.
    In this study, a coupled CMUA-WEF simulation model is developed based on the system
    dynamics approach. The model not only studies the three elements of WEF, supply
    and demand, but also conducts a comparative analysis of the three regions of BTH,
    and designs a total of four scenarios based on the possibility of future development,
    so as to facilitate the depiction of the trend of the WEF supply and demand system
    under different scenarios, and to provide theoretical basis for the government
    to formulate effective policy. The results show that: (1) Regarding demand, the
    aggregate demand for energy, food and water in the BTH will increase by about
    3–5 times, 3 times, and 2 times, respectively, from 2000 to 2050, among which
    the total demand for energy will increase most significantly. In contrast, the
    variation of local resource supply side is small, which leads to the deterioration
    of resource security. (2) The risk of water shortage is the greatest in resource
    security, with less than 30% self-sufficiency in water security in all three regions.
    (3) Scenario analysis for CMUA-BTH indicates that “choking flow” (S3) yields more
    pronounced effects compared to “open source” (S2), and therefore adhering to the
    reduction of food waste, promoting energy-saving technologies, and intensifying
    water-saving measures can effectively reduce the risk of water shortages in the
    three regions. Optimal resource security in S4 increases Hebei''s water pressure
    by 1.5%, alleviates Beijing''s pressure by 7.3%, and the implementation of the
    Xiongan New Area and the new energy development policy can help realize the synergistic
    development of BTH and the inter-regional linkage.'

- abstract: The North Western Sahara Aquifer System (NWSAS) is a vital groundwater
    source in a notably water-scarce region. However, impetuous agricultural expansion
    and poor resource management (e.g., over-irrigation, inefficient techniques) over
    the past decades have raised a number of challenges. In this exploratory study,
    we introduce an open access GIS-based model to help answer selected timely questions
    related to the agriculture, water and energy nexus in the region. First, the model
    uses spatial and tabular data to identify the location and extent of irrigated
    cropland. Then, it employs spatially explicit climatic datasets and mathematical
    formulation to estimate water and electricity requirements for groundwater irrigation
    in all identified locations. Finally, it evaluates selected supply options to
    meet the electricity demand and suggests the least-cost configuration in each
    location. Results indicate that full irrigation in the basin requires ~3.25 billion
    million m3 per year. This translates to ~730 GWh of electricity. Fossil fuels
    do provide the least-cost electricity supply option due to lower capital and subsidized
    operating costs. Hence, to improve the competitiveness of renewable technologies
    (RT) (i.e., solar), a support scheme to drop the capital cost of RTs is critically
    needed. Finally, moving towards drip irrigation can lead to ~47% of water abstraction
    savings in the NWSAS area.

- abstract: Energy modelling plays a crucial role in assisting governmental and policymaking
    bodies to strategise long-term investments within the context of energy transition.
    Among the well-established open-source optimisation models, OSeMOSYS—the Open-Source
    Energy Modelling System—stands out. This paper introduces clicSAND, a novel user
    interface designed for OSeMOSYS, aimed at reducing the learning curve and supporting
    novice energy modelers in efficiently conducting long-term investment analyses.
    clicSAND, freely available and open-source, features a user-friendly Excel interface
    for data input, integrated solvers, and a visualisation dashboard for result interpretation.
    The outcomes, projected up to 2070, hold the potential to inform policy decisions
    and mobilise financial resources for sustainable development endeavors, such as
    ensuring affordable and secure energy supply and mitigating climate change impacts.
    This advancement not only democratises access to energy modelling tools but also
    empowers policymakers and stakeholders to conduct thorough long-term investment
    analyses with ease. This paper elaborates on clicSAND’s key advantages, architecture,
    and functionalities. Additionally, it discusses the evolutionary journey from
    clicSAND 1.0 to 3.0, emphasising a commitment to continuous improvement and user-centric
    adaptation, thereby enhancing its utility and relevance. The inclusion of a South
    African case study, conducted during the EMP-A (Energy Modelling Platform for
    Africa) 2021 international capacity-building event, showcases clicSAND’s efficacy
    in facilitating knowledge transfer and skill development among inexperienced users,
    while providing a tangible example of its application in addressing specific regional
    energy challenges and policy contexts. Finally, current applications and future
    extensions of the software are also presented.

- abstract: Sector-based resource management approaches partly contribute to the insecurities
    in water, energy and food sectors and resources. These approaches fail to acknowledge
    and capture the interlinkages between these connected resources, a key strength
    in the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus approach. However, the multi-centric, multidimensional,
    and spatiotemporally dynamic WEF nexus is complex and uncertain, thus requiring
    dedicated tools that can unpack it. Various sources have blamed the slow uptake
    and practical implementation of the WEF nexus on the unavailability of appropriate
    tools and models. To confirm those claims with evidence, literature on WEF nexus
    tools was searched from Scopus and Web of Science and systematically reviewed
    using the PRISMA protocol. It was found that the WEF nexus tools are being developed
    increasingly, with a current cumulative number of at least 46 tools and models.
    However, their majority (61%) is unreachable to the intended users. Some available
    tools are in code format, which can undermine their applicability by users without
    programming skills. A good majority (70%) lack key capabilities such as geospatial
    features and transferability in spatial scale and geographic scope. Only 30% of
    the tools are applicable at local scales. In contrast, some tools are restricted
    in geographic scope and scale of application, for example, ANEMI 3 and WEF models
    for large and household scales, respectively. Most (61%) of the tools lack wide
    application in actual case studies; this was partly attributed to the tools not
    being readily available. Thus, efforts should be made to disseminate and ensure
    end-users' uptake and application of developed tools. Alternatively, the user-friendly
    tools should be developed on-demand as requested and inspired by potential clients.
    Developers should consider utility, transferability and scalability across uses
    and users when improving existing tools and developing new tools so that they
    are adaptable, only requiring new, specific location-adapted inputs and data.
    Where and when it is necessary to capture spatial dynamics of the WEF nexus, tools
    should be geographic information system (GIS)-enabled for automatic WEF nexus
    location selection, geospatial mapping, and visualization. Such GIS-enabled WEF
    nexus tools can provide a bird's eye view of hotspots and champions of WEF nexus
    practices.

- abstract: The Upper White Nile (UWN) basin plays a critical role in supporting essential
    ecosystem services and the livelihoods of millions of people in East Africa. The
    basin has been exposed to tremendous environmental pressures following high population
    growth, urbanisation, and land use change, all of which are compounded by the
    threats posed by climate change and insufficient financial and human resources.
    The water-energy-food-environment (WEFE) nexus provides a framework to assess
    solution options towards sustainable development by minimising the trade-offs
    between water, energy, and food resources. However, the majority of existing WEFE
    nexus indicators and tools tend to be developed without consideration of practitioners
    at the local level, thus constraining the practical application within real-world
    contexts. To try to address this gap and operationalise the WEFE nexus, we examined
    how local stakeholders frame the most pressing WEFE nexus challenges within the
    UWN basin, how these can be represented as indicators, and how existing WEFE nexus
    modelling tools could address this. The findings highlight the importance of declining
    water quality and aquatic ecosystem health as a result of deforestation and increasing
    agricultural intensity, with stakeholders expressing concerns for the uncertain
    impacts from climate change. Furthermore, a review of current WEFE nexus modelling
    tools reveals how they tend to be insufficient in addressing the most pressing
    environmental challenges within the basin, with a significant gap regarding the
    inclusion of water quality and aquatic ecosystem indicators. Subsequently, these
    findings are combined in order to guide the development of WEFE nexus indicators
    that have the potential to spatially model the trade-offs within the WEFE nexus
    in the UWN basin under climate change scenarios. This work provides an example
    of how incorporating local stakeholder's values and concerns can contribute to
    the development of meaningful indicators, that are fit-for-purpose and respond
    to the actual local needs.

- abstract: The unsustainable use of natural resources, in particular soil degradation
    and pollution, is one of the main factors contributing to the climate and biodiversity
    crisis. The European Union has outlined a new European Green Deal, whose objectives
    include increasing the overall quality of the agri-food chain in relation to environmental
    sustainability, focusing on reducing the use of pesticides and increasing the
    share of organic in overall production. A Nexus thinking perspective is applied
    to analyse this topic over a 50-year time horizon (2010–2060) for the agricultural
    system of the Basilicata Region (Southern Italy), represented by the TIMES Land-WEF,
    an optimizing, bottom-up energy-technology model, built to investigate the interactions
    and interrelations between water, energy food and land. The novelty of this modelling
    approach is the choice of land use as the guiding parameter of the optimization
    process. The main objectives of the Farm to Fork Strategy are modelled as system
    constraints and the scenario analysis allows to characterise their effects on
    the evolution of the agricultural system over the examined time. The results show
    that the pesticide reduction constraint leads to an increase in land use by organic
    crops from 24.6 % to 32.4 % in 2060. In particular, this is due to the increased
    contribution of cereal, forage, olive growing crops, permanent meadows and pastures,
    which lead to a 46 % reduction in irrigation water consumption. On the other hand,
    the reduction in inorganic fertilizers is not accompanied by a significant increase
    in organic crops, but resulted in the reduction of cereal crops.

- abstract: Climate change is increasingly affecting the supply of resources such
    as water and food. From 2015 to 2018, Cape Town endured its most severe drought
    on record. Yet, resource management often occurs in isolation, which contrasts
    with the holistic perspective provided by the nexus concept that recognizes the
    interdependence of resource sectors. This study employs system dynamics modeling,
    to examine the City of Cape Town’s (CoCT) water-food trade-offs and interactions
    using qualitative and quantitative approaches. It assesses various policies proposed
    by the CoCT, to improve system resilience and to boost future water supplies,
    examining their efficacy and potential drawbacks. These policies are tested against
    future scenarios including population growth and climate change predictions of
    different severities. The simulation results show an increase in food demand,
    which is mainly linked to population growth and a significant decrease in water
    availability. Without intervention, the CoCT is expected to experience serious
    water shortages within the 40-year simulation period. The findings indicate that
    the CoCT’s strategies will effectively secure adequate water for its expanding
    population. However, a major concern was found to be the proposed intensification
    of aquifer exploitation. The model predicts that such an approach could lead to
    overabstraction of some aquifers, compromising their sustainability.

- abstract: Increasing renewable sources in the energy mix is essential to mitigate
    climate change, not least in countries where the energy demand is likely to rise
    over the coming decades to reduce or even skip durations of time where fossils
    dominate. For Africa, solar photovoltaic (PV) and inland wind energy, combined
    with hydropower, provide significant and untapped potentials, whereas trends and
    robustness measures need further investigation. This study aims to gain insight
    into distributed trends in solar PV and wind energy potentials over Africa. This
    study employs relevant metrics, including relative change, model agreement, robustness,
    bias, and absolute levels for every available model combination and two climate
    scenarios, with energy planning purposes in mind. The study finds that regional
    climate models were the primary control of spatio-temporal patterns over their
    driving global climate model. Solar PV potentials show more coherence between
    models, a lower bias and general high potentials in most African regions than
    wind potentials. Favourable locations for inland wind energy include mainly the
    regions of greater Sahara and the Horn region. For wind and solar potentials combined,
    scattered locations within Sahara stand out as the most favourable across scenarios
    and periods. The analysis of minimum energy potentials shows stable conditions
    despite low potentials in certain regions. The results demonstrate a potential
    for solar and wind power in most of the African regions and highlight why solar
    and wind power or synergies of energy mix should be considered for local energy
    planning and storage solutions.

- abstract: 'This research examines Botswana’s significant reliance on coal and imported
    fossil fuels for electricity generation, contributing to high carbon emissions
    and energy insecurity influenced by volatile fuel prices and supply challenges.
    The study utilizes the Open-Source Energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS) to explore
    cost-effective renewable energy strategies to meet Botswana’s Nationally Determined
    Contributions (NDCs) and enhance energy security by 2050, analysing six scenarios:
    Least Cost (LC), Business-As-Usual (BAU), Net Zero by 2050 (NZ), Coal Phase Out
    by 2045 (CPO), Fossil Fuel Phase Out by 2045 (FFPO), and Import Phase Out by 2045
    (IMPPO). Our key findings highlight the critical role of solar technologies—photovoltaic
    (PV), storage, and concentrated solar power (CSP)—in transitioning to a sustainable
    energy future, especially under the Net Zero and Import Phase Out scenarios. This
    research demonstrates the economic and environmental benefits of transitioning
    away from fossil fuels, with the Fossil Fuel Phase Out scenario yielding a USD
    31 million saving over the Business-As-Usual approach and reducing investment
    costs by USD 2 billion, albeit with a slight increase in light fuel oil imports.
    The study underscores the need for substantial capital investments, particularly
    in the Net Zero and Import Phase Out scenarios, necessitating private sector financing.
    Policy recommendations include adopting detailed strategies for solar PV and storage
    expansion, updating renewable energy targets, phasing out coal and natural gas,
    and bolstering the regulatory framework. These strategies are crucial for Botswana
    to achieve decarbonization and energy independence, aligning with global climate
    goals and national energy security objectives.'

- abstract: Africa's economic and population growth prospects are likely to increase
    energy and water demands. This quantitative study shows that energy decarbonisation
    pathways reduce water withdrawals (WWs) and water consumption (WC) relative to
    the baseline scenario. However, the more aggressive decarbonisation pathway (1.5
    °C) leads to higher overall WWs than the 2.0 °C scenario but lower WC levels by
    2065. By 2065, investments in low-carbon energy infrastructure increase annual
    WWs from 1% (52 bcm) in the 2.0 °C to 2% (85 bcm) in the 1.5 °C scenarios of total
    renewable water resources in Africa compared to 3% (159 bcm) in the baseline scenario
    with lower final energy demands in the mitigation scenarios. WC decreases from
    1.2 bcm in the 2.0 °C to 1 bcm in the 1.5 °C scenario, compared to 2.2 bcm in
    the baseline scenario by 2065, due to the lower water intensity of the low-carbon
    energy systems. To meet the 1.5 °C pathway, the energy sector requires a higher
    WW than the 2.0 °C scenario, both in total and per unit of final energy. Overall,
    these findings demonstrate the crucial role of integrated water-energy planning,
    and the need for joined-up carbon policy and water resources management for the
    continent to achieve climate-compatible growth.
